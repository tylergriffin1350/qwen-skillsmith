## Field Documentation

### Placeholder Conventions

| Placeholder | Convention | Example |
|-------------|-----------|---------|
| `{curly-braces}` | Variable interpolation — replaced with exact user input | `{skill-name}` → `revops-expert` |
| `[square-brackets]` | Human-written prose — replaced with descriptive text | `[role definition]` → `Senior revenue operations strategist` |

### Conditional Sections

| Section | When to Include |
|---------|----------------|
| Commands | Always for `suite` and `standalone`. Omit for `task-only`. |
| Tasks | Include if skill has guided workflows. Most skills do. |
| Frameworks | Include if skill carries domain knowledge. Omit for pure utility skills. |
| Templates | Include if skill produces structured output. |
| Context | Include if skill needs to remember state between sessions. |
| Checklists | Include if skill has quality gates or validation steps. |

### Section Notes

- **Identity** is always fully populated — no optional fields.
- **Persona** may be minimal for `task-only` skills (role + 1 style note is sufficient).
- **Content Architecture** sections with no entries should show "None" rather than an empty table.
- **Notes** captures anything that doesn't fit the structured sections — edge cases, open questions, design rationale.
